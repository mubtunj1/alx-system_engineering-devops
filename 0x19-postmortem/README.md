## Postmortem: Nginx Installation Outage

### Issue Summary:
Duration: June 10, 2023, 09:00 AM to June 10, 2023, 10:30 AM (UTC)
Impact: The website service was down during the outage period, resulting in a complete loss of functionality for all users. Approximately 100% of the users were affected.

Root Cause: An incorrect Nginx configuration led to a miscommunication between the load balancer and the backend servers, causing the service outage.

### Timeline:
- 09:00 AM: The issue was detected when the monitoring system sent an alert for high latency and a sudden drop in the number of successful requests.
- Actions Taken: The incident response team initiated an investigation into the system logs and network configurations, suspecting a potential network issue or misconfiguration.
- Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:
  - The team initially focused on network-related issues, including investigating the load balancer configuration and firewall settings.
  - They also examined the backend server logs to identify any potential errors or performance bottlenecks.
- Escalation: As the investigation progressed, the incident was escalated to the infrastructure team and the Nginx subject matter expert for further analysis and support.
- 10:00 AM: The incident was resolved after identifying the root cause and implementing the necessary fixes.
- Resolution: The team discovered that a recent configuration change in the Nginx server caused a mismatch with the load balancer's expectations. The load balancer was unable to route traffic properly to the backend servers, resulting in the service outage. To resolve the issue, the team corrected the Nginx configuration and restarted the service.

### Root Cause and Resolution
- Root Cause: The root cause of the issue was an incorrect Nginx configuration. The recent changes caused a mismatch with the load balancer's configuration, leading to communication failure between the load balancer and the backend servers.
- Resolution: To fix the issue, the team reverted the Nginx configuration to a known working state and ensured that it aligned with the load balancer's expectations. After applying the corrected configuration, they restarted the Nginx service, restoring the normal functionality of the website.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- Improvement/Fixes:
  - Enhance the change management process to include thorough configuration review and validation steps before deploying any changes to critical systems.
  - Implement automated configuration testing to verify the compatibility and integrity of the load balancer and backend server configurations.
- Tasks to Address the Issue:
  - Create a detailed playbook outlining the correct steps for Nginx configuration changes, including testing and validation procedures.
  - Conduct a post-incident review with the infrastructure and development teams to identify and address any potential configuration gaps or inconsistencies.
  - Implement automated monitoring and alerting for Nginx configuration changes to detect any future discrepancies promptly.

By conducting a thorough investigation, identifying the root cause, and implementing the necessary fixes, we were able to resolve the Nginx installation outage. The incident highlighted the importance of careful configuration management and validation procedures to maintain the stability and reliability of critical systems. Moving forward, the proposed corrective and preventative measures will help mitigate similar issues and ensure the smooth operation of our services.
